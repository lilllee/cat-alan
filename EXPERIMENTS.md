# Experiment log

Model training runs and their results, newest first. Git history tracks code
changes; this file tracks the numbers that came out of them.

Conventions:
- One entry per training/evaluation run worth remembering (skip broken runs).
- Always record: date, data (source + size), setup, and the honest metric —
  accuracy on **unseen cats / held-out samples**, not cross-validation.
- Update the README accuracy table when a model ships to the app.

## 2026-07-07 — Context: AST + prosody features *(tested, not shipped)*

- **Data**: same CatMeows 3-class split (201 train / 75 test, unseen cats).
- **Setup**: concat 3 prosodic features (duration, mean F0, intonation slope in
  octaves/s) from `models/prosody.py` (librosa pyin) onto the 768-d AST
  embedding → same regularized logistic head. Pipeline adds
  `actions/extract_prosody.py`.
- **Result**: **no change on unseen cats — 58.67% vs 58.67% AST-only.** 5-fold
  CV nudged up (71.7% → 72.7%) but that's the inflated in-training metric.
  Train-set class separation is real (brushing rises +0.19 oct/s; food is
  shorter & higher F0), but the prosody distribution shifts across individuals
  (brushing's slope flips sign train→test), so it doesn't transfer to new cats —
  consistent with Russo et al. 2025 (meows highly variable between cats).
- **Decision**: keep AST-only deployed (`use_prosody=False`); `train_ast_head.py`
  ships prosody only if it strictly beats AST-only on the test set, so the app
  avoids the pyin cost for zero gain. Prosody plumbing kept for the planned
  single-cat model, where individual variation is removed and it may help.

## 2026-07-06 — Context: AST embeddings + logistic head *(shipped)*

- **Data**: CatMeows via HF `oliveirabruno01/openfarm-catmeows` (Zenodo 4008297),
  3 classes: brushing / isolation / waiting-for-food.
- **Setup**: frozen `MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593` embeddings +
  logistic regression head (`actions/extract_ast_embeddings.py` →
  `actions/train_ast_head.py`). Head saved to `models/context_ast_head.joblib`.
- **Result**: **~59% on unseen cats** (chance 33%). CV on the training set
  gives ~72% — inflated because the model partly keys on individual cats and
  recording conditions, not context. Trust the unseen-cat number.

## 2026-07-06 — Context: raw-waveform M5 baseline *(not shipped)*

- **Data**: same CatMeows 3-class split.
- **Setup**: M5 on raw waveforms (`actions/train_context.py`).
- **Result**: ~36% on unseen cats — barely above chance. Raw waveforms don't
  transfer across cats at this data size; embeddings approach kept instead.

## (upstream) — Sentiment: M5 on raw waveforms *(shipped)*

- **Data**: CatSound (Zenodo 4724180), 10 emotion classes. Augmented with time
  stretching, pitch shifting, Gaussian noise.
- **Setup**: M5 on raw 44.1 kHz waveforms (`actions/train.py`,
  `configs/config.json`). Checkpoint at `examples/model/data/model.pth`.
- **Result**: **~58% on 50 held-out samples**. Trained by upstream
  (dogeplusplus); kept as-is in this fork.

## Planned

Ordered roughly by effort. Each should land as a dated entry above when run.

1. ~~Add explicit prosodic features to the Context model.~~ **Done 2026-07-07
   (see entry above): no unseen-cat gain, not shipped.** Prosody shifts across
   individuals so it doesn't transfer to new cats; revisit for the single-cat
   model (item 3).
2. **Add an MFCC + SVM baseline** (Skyler-Luo's recipe: 20 MFCC + Δ + ΔΔ, 4
   stats = 240-d, RBF SVM). A cheap third point of comparison against the AST
   head. Evaluate on the **unseen-cat split**, not the inflated 10-fold CV
   those references report.
3. **Record my own cat per situation** (food / play / angry) and train a
   single-cat classifier. Motivation: meows encode little individual identity
   but are *highly variable* between cats (Russo et al. 2025: domestic meows
   have far greater acoustic dispersion than wild felids), so a generic model
   generalizes poorly — but a **single-cat** model sidesteps individual
   variation entirely and should beat both generic models. Use the Meowsic
   protocol: video+audio, per-situation, controlled stimuli.
4. **Reach-goal architecture: JL-TFMSFNet** (Mel spectrogram + multi-scale
   feature extraction + time-frequency attention). Reported ~94–96% on its own
   datasets; a target if the feature-engineering steps above plateau.
